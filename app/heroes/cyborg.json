  "longtitle": "Although a star athlete, Vic Stone only yearned for his father’s approval. But Dad was too focused on his scientific career to notice… until the day Vic became his greatest experiment. After Vic suffered a grave injury, his father saved him by replacing over half his body with cybernetic parts.Now Cyborg is plugged into every computer on Earth, and no firewall—or brick wall—can keep him out. While his cybernetic enhancements provide superhuman strength, speed, and endurance, that same technology destroys his chances to live as a professional athlete. Now flourishing in the digital realm, Vic is desperately alone in the physical world—and still longs for his father’s affection.  Hungry to find purpose again, he fights alongside the World’s Greatest Super Heroes.",
